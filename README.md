The Réception plugin comes with two interactive blocks, you'll both find into the Widgets category:

- The **Member's presentation** allows your members to customize their biological information.
- The **Member's contact form** allows your members to send each others emails and allows visitors to contact members by email once they accomplished some email verification steps.

## What are the email verification steps?

Visitors wishing to contact a site member will first need to request a verification code they will receive on their email address. Once they have successfully verified their email address, they will be able to contact site members from their front page's contact form.

## Verified emails moderation.

If you need to moderate some visitors, search for their email address into the verified emails. Once found, if you hover their confirmation code, you will be able to mark them as spam: they won't be able to contact your members anymore. You will also be able to delete them from the verified emails.
